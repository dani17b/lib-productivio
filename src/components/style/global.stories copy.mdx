# Default global style
The `body` element is the container for all content on the webpage. The styles applied to it are:

- `display: flex`: This makes the body element a flex container, allowing its children to be arranged with the flexbox model.

- `flex-direction: column`: This sets the direction of the flexbox to be vertical, so that child elements are stacked on top of each other.

- `align-items: center`: This centers the child elements vertically within the container.

- `margin: 0; padding: 0;`: This removes any default margin and padding applied to the body element, so that there is no unwanted space around it.

- `font-family: $default-font;`: This sets the font family of the text inside the body element to the value of the `$default-font` variable defined elsewhere in the SCSS file.

- `@media (max-width: $mobile-breakpoint) {...}`: This applies styles to the body element when the screen width is less than or equal to the value of the `$mobile-breakpoint` variable. The styles applied within this media query are:

  - `width: 100vw;`: This sets the width of the body element to 100% of the viewport width, ensuring that it takes up the entire screen.

  - `max-width: 100vw;`: This sets the maximum width of the body element to be 100% of the viewport width, ensuring that it does not exceed the screen width.

  - `box-sizing: border-box;`: This ensures that the total width of the body element includes any padding or borders applied to it, rather than being added on top of the specified width.
